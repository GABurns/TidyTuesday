# TidyTuesday
A repository for sharing the code used to produce data visualizations for [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges. 

I've done a lot of dataviz for business reports[^1], scientific journal papers[^2] and slide decks[^3] but they've generally been generic plots
with minor aesthetic adjustements.

Having known about the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenage I decieded to take part in some challenages
- Upskill in new packages 📦 or methods
- Create a portfolio
- Actively participate in the R community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

I've 2 young kids so I'm going to pick challenages where I want to use a new package/method and time bound myself to 2-3 hours to complete. All feeback is welcome!

[^1]: Focus tends on an figure to provide implied authority rather than a data story.
[^2]: Scientific journal papers were often demanding b&w for printing and wanted as much information as possible that it 
generally made more sense to include a table.
[^3]: PowerPoint....the bane of my life.
